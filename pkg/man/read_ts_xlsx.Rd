\usage{
read_ts_xlsx(filename, sheet = NULL, range = NULL, skiprow = NA,
  skipcol = NA, rowwise, frequency = NA, labels = c("no", "after",
  "before"), na_string = "", name_fun)

\arguments{
\item{filename}{a string with the filename}

\item{sheet}{Sheet to read. Either a string (the name of a sheet),
or an integer (the position of the sheet). Ignored if the sheet is
specified via range. If neither argument specifies the sheet,
defaults to the first sheet}

\item{range}{A cell range to read from, as described in
\code{\link[readxl]{cell-specification}}. Includes typical Excel ranges
like "B3:D87", possibly including the
sheet name like "Budget!B2:G14", and more.
Strictly, even if the range forces the inclusion of leading or trailing
empty rows or columns.
Takes precedence over skiprow, skipcol and sheet}

\item{skiprow}{the number of rows to skip, including leading empty rows.
Ignored if \code{range} is given. By default, all leading empty rows are
skipped.}

\item{skipcol}{the number of columns to skip, including empty columns.
Ignored if \code{range} is given. By default, all leading empty columns are
skipped.}

\item{rowwise}{a logical value: are the timeseries stored rowwise?
If not specified, then \code{read_ts_xlsx} tries to figure out itself if
the timeseries are stored rowwise or columnwise}

\item{frequency}{the frequency of the timeseries.
This argument is mandatory if the file contains period texts without
frequency indicator (for example "2011-1")}

\item{labels}{label option. See details.}

\item{na_string}{Character vector of strings to use for missing values.
By default, \code{read_ts_xlsx} treats blank cells as missing data.}

\item{name_fun}{function to apply to the names of the timeseries}
}
\value{
a \code{\link{regts}} object
}
\description{
This function attempts to read timeseries from an xls(x) file.
The xls(x) file is actually read by function \code{\link[readxl]{read_excel}}
of package \code{readxl}.
The timeseries can be stored both rowwise or columnwise on the sheet.
The function tries to find valid period texts on the sheet.
Valid period texts should have the format recognized by function
\code{\link{period}}, for example \code{"2010Q2"},
\code{"2010M2"}, \code{"2011"} or \code{"2011-1"}.
}
\details{
An integer value is considered as a period wih frequency year.
In many cases, this function will read timeseries correctly.
However, \emph{you should always carefully check the results of this
function}. If the function fails or if the result is not
what you want, then you have to read the data into a data frame
(for example by using function \code{read_excel} of package \code{readxl}),
then convert the data frame to a standard columnwise data frame
and finally convert it to a \code{\link{regts}} by using function
\code{\link{as.regts}}.

If argument \code{rowwise} has not been specified, then
function \code{read_ts_xlsx} tries to guess if the timeseries are stored
rowwise based on the position of periods in the sheet.,

\strong{rowwise timeseries}

\if{html}{\figure{xlsschemarowwise.jpg}{options: width=260}}
\if{latex}{\figure{xlsschemarowwise.jpg}{options: width=5in}}

For rowwise timeseries, the function searches for the first
row with periods.  All rows before the period row are ignored.
The first non-empty column in the sheet should contain  the timeseries names.
Otherwise, use argument \code{skipcol} to specify the number of columns
to skip. There may be one or more columns between the column with variable names
and the columns where the actual timeseries are stored.
If argument \code{labels = "after"}  then the texts in these
columns will be used to create timeseries labels. If \code{labels = "before"},
the last column before the data is supposed to contain
the variable names. The columns before the variable name column
now should contain label information.

\strong{columnwise timeseries}

\if{html}{\figure{xlsschemacolumnwise.jpg}{options: width=240}}
\if{latex}{\figure{xlsschemacolumnwise.jpg}{options: width=5in}}

For columnwise timeseries, the first non-empty row that has been read (see
argument \code{range} or \code{skiprow}) should contain the variable names.
The periods can be in any column on the sheet.
All columns to the left of the time column are ignored.
There may be one or more rows between the column names and the rows
where the actual timeseries are stored.
If argument \code{labels = "after"}  then the texts in these
rows will be used to create timeseries labels.
the last row before the data is supposed to contain
the variable names. Now the row before the variable name columns
should contain label information. If argument \code{use_colnames = TRUE},
then the label option \code{"before"} is not allowed for columnwise
timeseries, since in that case the column names are the timeseries names.

By default, the function skips all leading empty rows and columns,
just as \code{read_excel}. This behaviour can be overruled by specifying
arguments \code{range}, \code{skiprow} or \code{skipcol}.

Sometimes it helps to supply information about the structure of
the data on the sheet. Specify option  \code{rowwise} if you know
that the timeseries are stored rowwise or columnwise. Specify
argument \code{frequency} if you already know the frequency of the timeseries.
Argument \code{frequency} is mandatory if a general period format
such as  \code{"2011-1"} has been used.

With \code{name_fun} a function can be applied to names of the timeseries,
e.g. \code{\link{tolower}}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
read_ts_xlsx("series.xlsx", skipcol = 2, na_string = c("", "NA"))
read_ts_xlsx("data.xlsx", sheet = "Budget", labels = "after",
             name_fun = tolower)
}

}
