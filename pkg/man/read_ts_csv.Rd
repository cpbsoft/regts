read_ts_csv(filename, columnwise, frequency = NA, skiprow, skipcol,
  labels = c("no", "after", "before"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{a string with the filename}

\item{columnwise}{a logical value: are the timeseries stored columnwise?
If not specified, then \code{read_ts} tries to figure out itself if
the timeseries are stored columnwise or rowwise}

\item{frequency}{the frequency of the timeseries.
This argument is mandatory if the file contains a period texts without
frequency indicator (for example "2011-1")}

\item{skiprow}{the number of rows to skip}

\item{skipcol}{the number of columns to skip}

\item{labels}{label option. See details.}

\description{
This function attempts to read timeseries from a csv file.
The csv file is actually read by function \code{\link[data.table]{fread}}
of package \code{data.table}.
The timeseries can be stored both rowwise or columnwise.
The function tries to find valid period texts.
Valid period texts should have the format recognized by function
\code{\link{regperiod}}, for example \code{"2010Q2"},
\code{"2010M2"}, \code{"2011"} or \code{"2011-1"}.
An integer value is considered as a period wih frequency year.
In many cases, this function will read timeseries correctly.
However, \emph{you should always carefully check the results of this
function}. If the result is not
what you want, then you have read the data into a data frame
(for example by using function \code{read.csv} or the function
\code{fread} of package \code{data.table}),
then convert the data frame to a standard columnwise data frame
and finally convert it to a \code{regts} by using funtion \code{as.regts}.
}
\details{
If argument \code{columnwise} has not been specified, then
function \code{read_ts_xlsx} searches for any valid period text in the first
row after the skipped rows. If a valid period was found, then
\code{read_ts} assumes that the timeseries are stored rowwise. Otherwise it
assumes that the timeseries are store columnwise.

\strong{columnwise timeseries}

For columnwise timeseries, the first row that is not skipped (see
argument \code{skiprow}) should contain the variable names.
For columnwise timeseries, the first row that is not skipped (see
argument \code{skiprow}) should contain the variable names.
The periods can be in any column.
All columns to the left of the time column are ignored.
There may be one or more rows between the column names and the rows
where the actual timeseries are stored.
If argument \code{labels = "after"}  then the texts in these
rows will be used to create timeseries labels.
the last row before the columns where the data start is supposed to contain
the variable names and the row before the variable name columns
contain label information. If argument \code{use_colnames = TRUE},
then the label option \code{"before"} is not allowed for columnwise
timeseries, since in that the column names are the timeseries names.

\strong{rowwise timeseries}

\if{html}{\figure{xlsfileschema.jpg}{options: width=200}}
\if{latex}{\figure{xlsfileschema.jpg}{options: width=5in}}

For rowwise timeseries, the first row that is not skipped (see
argument \code{skiprow}) should contain the periods.
Columns for which the corresponding period is not a valid period
are ignored. The timeseries names can be in the row names or in
the first column.
There may be one or more columns between the column with variable names
and the columns where the actual timeseries are stored.
If argument \code{labels = "after"}  then the texts in these
columns will be used to create timeseries labels. If \code{labels = "before"},
the last column before the columns where the data start is supposed to contain
the variable names and the columns before the variable name columns
contain label information.

Sometimes it helps to supply information about the structure of
the data in the file. Specify option  \code{columnwise} is you know
that the timeseries ares stored rowwise or columnwise. Specify
argument \code{frequency} is you already know the frequency of the timeseries.
Argument \code{frequency} is mandatory if a general period format
such as  \code{"2011-1"} has been used.
