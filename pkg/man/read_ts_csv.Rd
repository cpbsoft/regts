\title{Read timeseries from a csv file}
\usage{
read_ts_csv(filename, rowwise, frequency = NA, skiprow = 0,
  skipcol = 0, labels = c("after", "before", "no"), sep = "auto",
  fill = FALSE, dec = if (sep != ".") "." else ",", na_string = "",
  name_fun)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{a string with the filename}

\item{rowwise}{a logical value: are the timeseries stored rowwise?
If not specified, then \code{read_ts_csv} tries to figure out itself if
the timeseries are stored rowwise or columnwise.}

\item{frequency}{the frequency of the timeseries.
This argument is mandatory if the file contains a period texts without
frequency indicator (for example "2011-1").}

\item{skiprow}{the number of rows to skip.
If 0 (default) and if argument \code{fill} is \code{FALSE},
then comment rows are automatically skipped.
See Details.}

\item{skipcol}{the number of columns to skip}

\item{labels}{label option. See Details.}

\item{sep}{the separator between columns. If not specified, then
the separator is determined automatically by inspecting the
first 30 lines of the csv file (see the details of function
\code{\link[data.table]{fread}}).}

\item{fill}{logical (default is \code{FALSE}). If \code{TRUE} then in case
the rows have unequal length, blank fields are implicitly filled
with \code{NA}.}

\item{dec}{the decimal separator as in \code{base::read.csv}.
If not "." (default) then usually ",".}

\item{na_string}{Character vector of strings to use for missing values.
By default, \code{read_ts_csv} treats blank cells as missing data.}

\item{name_fun}{function to apply to the names of the timeseries.}
}
\value{
a \code{regts} object
}
\description{
This function attempts to read timeseries from a csv file.
The csv file is actually read by function \code{\link[data.table]{fread}}
of package \code{data.table}.
The timeseries can be stored both rowwise or columnwise.
The function tries to find fields with valid period texts.
Period texts should have the format recognized by function
\code{\link{period}}, for example \code{"2010Q2"}, \code{"2010.2Q"},
\code{"2010m2"}, \code{"2011"} or \code{"2011-1"}.
}
\details{
In many cases, this function will read timeseries correctly.
However, \emph{you should always carefully check the results of this
function}. If the function fails or if the result is not
what you want, then you have to read the data into a data frame
(for example by using function \code{read.csv} or the function
\code{fread} of package \code{data.table}),
then convert the data frame to a standard columnwise data frame
and finally convert it to a \code{\link{regts}} by using function
\code{\link{as.regts}}.

If argument \code{rowwise} has not been specified, then
function \code{read_ts_xlsx} tries to guess if the timeseries are stored
rowwise or columnwise based on the positions of the fields with period texts.

\strong{rowwise timeseries}

For rowwise timeseries, the function searches for the first
row with periods.  All rows before the period row are ignored.
Columns without a valid period in the period row are also ignored.
The first non-empty column should contain the timeseries names
(or labels if argument \code{labels = "before"}, see the discussion below).
Otherwise use argument \code{skipcol} to specify the number of
columns to skip.

\if{html}{\figure{xlsschemarowwise.jpg}{options: width=200}}
\if{latex}{\figure{xlsschemarowwise.jpg}{options: width=5in}}

There may be more than one column before the columns with timeseries values
(data columns). In that case one column should contain the variable names.
The other columns before the first data column are used to create
timeseries labels (see \code{\link{ts_labels}}). If argument
\code{labels = "after"} (default), then the first
column contains the variable names. If \code{labels = "no"} the first column
also contains variable names but the other columns before the first data
column are ignored. If argument \code{labels = "before"}, then the variable
names should be in the last column before the first data column.

\strong{columnwise timeseries}

For columnwise timeseries, the first non-empty row that is not skipped (see
argument \code{skiprow}) should contain the variable names
(or labels if argument \code{labels = "before"}, see the discussion below).
The periods can be in any column.
Rows without a valid period in the period column are ignored.
All columns to the left of the period column are also ignored.

\if{html}{\figure{xlsschemacolumnwise.jpg}{options: width=200}}
\if{latex}{\figure{xlsschemacolumnwise.jpg}{options: width=5in}}

There may be more than one row before the rows with timeseries values
(data rows). In that case one row should contain the variable names.
The other rows before the first data row are used to create
timeseries labels (see \code{\link{ts_labels}}).
If argument  \code{labels = "after"} (default), then the first
row contains the variable names. If \code{labels = "no"} the first row
also contains variable names but the other rows before the first data
row are ignored. If argument \code{labels = "before"}, then the variable
names should be in the last row before the first data row.

Sometimes it helps to supply information about the structure of
the data on the csv file. Specify argument \code{rowwise} if you know
that the timeseries are stored rowwise or columnwise. Specify
argument \code{frequency} if you already know the frequency of the timeseries.
Argument \code{frequency} is mandatory if a general period format
such as  \code{"2011-1"} has been used.

With \code{name_fun} a function can be applied to names of the timeseries,
e.g. \code{\link{tolower}}.

\strong{automatic row skip}

If \code{skiprow = 0}, then the first rows with less columns than
the rest of the file are automatically skipped. These rows are assumed
to be comment rows. This procedure is described in detail
in the documentation of function
\code{\link[data.table]{fread}} of the \code{data.table} package.
Briefly, \code{fread} first determines the number of columns
and then searches for the first data row based on this number of columns.
All rows before this data row are skipped.

If argument \code{fill} is \code{TRUE}, then all rows have the same
number of columns, and automatic row skipping is therefore
disabled.
